# ORB
This code evaluates the performance of ORB by Constructing an Image Classifier.<br/>
Caltech101 Dataset is used for Image Classification.<br/>
For each label it computes the Error Rate in Image Classification.<br/>
For Each label it computes the Precision/Recall Values to manifest the degree of effective Classification.<br/>
It conctructs a Bag of Visual Words model that is passed to the SVM for Classification.<br/>
Change the Dictionary Size to obtain optimal results.<br/>
Example:-Results for Airplane and Bike, with Airplane as label 1 and Bike as label 2:<br/>
  1)Error Rate = 0.121462<br/>
  2)Precision = 0.917676<br/>
  3)Recall = 0.845982<br/>
