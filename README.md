# ORB
This code evaluates the performance of ORB by Constructing an Image Classifier.<br/>
Caltech101 Dataset is used for Image Classification.<br/>
For each label it computes the Error Rate in Image Classification.<br/>
For Each label it computes the Precision/Recall Values to manifest the degree of effective Classification.<br/>
It conctructs a Bag of Visual Words that is passed to the SVM for Classification.<br/>
Change the Dictionary Size to obtain the ooptimal results.<br/>
